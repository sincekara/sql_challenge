## SQL Analysis-Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

![](Images/sql.png)

## Background

The major task in this project is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this analysis, it is needed to design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, the next items must be performed:

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

#### Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

#### Data Engineering

* Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Analysis

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1987.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Duangkaew" and last names begin with "P."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In ascending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

* Consult [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#postgresql) for more information.

* If using a password, do not upload your password to your GitHub repository. See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I) and [https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/](https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/) for more information.

2. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

3. You may also include a technical report in markdown format, in which you outline the data engineering steps taken in the homework assignment.
